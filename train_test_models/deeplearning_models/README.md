# nlp-benchmark base repository (origin)
This is a fork of the Github repository by ArdalanM: https://github.com/ArdalanM .

The original code can be found at: https://github.com/ArdalanM/nlp-benchmarks .

We have modified the original repository such that the robustness analysis of the 
chosen deep learning models (transformer and VDCNN) is possible. 
We have re-trained all models and kept the data-preprocessing and model parameters 
as were presented in the original repository.

Please consult the original repository for more further details.
